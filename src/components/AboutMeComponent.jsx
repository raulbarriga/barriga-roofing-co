              Iâ€™ve been an in-demand Roofing Contractor in the greater Bay Area
              for more than 30 years. I have the know-how to tackle everything
              from the smallest of repairs to large-scale projects. No matter
              the size of the job. I always work hard to ensure my clients are
              completely satisfied with my work. Call to schedule an initial
              consultation today. Ask for Ricardo.
